# 👋 Hi, I’m Chirag Lalitcumar

## Senior Business Analyst | Data, Systems & Decision Intelligence

I’m a Senior Business Analyst with 10+ years of experience helping organisations make better decisions by translating complex data and systems into clear business insight. I’ve worked across FinTech and large-scale public sector environments, partnering with Finance, Operations, Product, and Leadership teams to drive measurable outcomes.

My strength lies in **bridging business needs and technical delivery** — turning ambiguity into structured requirements, scalable data models, and insight that leaders can act on.
